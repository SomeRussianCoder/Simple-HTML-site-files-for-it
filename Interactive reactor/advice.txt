You should separate code and resources
keep content in a separate folder from code
Makes it look cleaner.

Write game code in pure JS/Javascript by
using Javascript/HTML5 game libraries.

You can also make the game using the Unity
Game Engine and code it in C# or Javascript
And compile the game as an HTML5 runtime.
Making it in unity would be easier since
You would have a neat and more easily
readable platform for making the game.
